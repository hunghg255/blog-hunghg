### Q. 31. What is the event.target when clicking the button?

```html

  <div onclick="console.log('second div')">
    <button onclick="console.log('button')">Click!</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

- A: Outer `div`
- B: Inner `div`
- C: `button`
- D: An array of all nested elements.

**_Answer: C_**

The deepest nested element that caused the event is the target of the event. You can stop bubbling by `event.stopPropagation`

### Q. 32. When you click the paragraph, what's the logged output?

```html
<div onclick="console.log('div')">
  <p onclick="console.log('p')">Click here!</p>
</div>
```

- A: `p` `div`
- B: `div` `p`
- C: `p`
- D: `div`

<details>

**_Answer: A_**

If we click `p`, we see two logs: `p` and `div`. During event propagation, there are 3 phases: capturing, target, and bubbling. By default, event handlers are executed in the bubbling phase (unless you set `useCapture` to `true`). It goes from the deepest nested element outwards.

### Q. 33. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = { name: 'Lydia' };

function sayHi(age) {
  return `${this.name} is ${age}`;
}

console.log(sayHi.call(person, 21));
console.log(sayHi.bind(person, 21));
```

- A: `undefined is 21` `Lydia is 21`
- B: `function` `function`
- C: `Lydia is 21` `Lydia is 21`
- D: `Lydia is 21` `function`

**_Answer: D_**

With both, we can pass the object to which we want the `this` keyword to refer to. However, `.call` is also _executed immediately_!

`.bind.` returns a _copy_ of the function, but with a bound context! It is not executed immediately.

### Q. 34. What's the output?

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  return (() => 0)();
}

console.log(typeof sayHi());
```

- A: "object"
- B: "number"
- C: "function"
- D: "undefined"

<details>

    <b>ðŸ’¡ Answer</b>
    </summary>

**_Answer: B_**

The `sayHi` function returns the returned value of the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). This function returned `0`, which is type `"number"`.

FYI: there are only 7 built-in types: `null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `object`, and `symbol`. `"function"` is not a type, since functions are objects, it's of type `"object"`.

### Q. 35. Which of these values are falsy?

```javascript
0;
new Number(0);
('');
(' ');
new Boolean(false);
undefined;
```

- A: 0, '', undefined
- B: 0, new Number(0), '', new Boolean(false), undefined
- C: 0, '', new Boolean(false), undefined
- D: All of them are falsy

<details>
    <summary>
    <b>ðŸ’¡ Answer</b>
    </summary>

**_Answer: A_**

There are 8 falsy values:

- `undefined`
- `null`
- `NaN`
- `false`
- `''` (empty string)
- `0`
- `-0`
- `0n` (BigInt(0))

Function constructors, like `new Number` and `new Boolean` are truthy.

### Q. 36. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log(typeof typeof 1);
```

- A: "number"
- B: "string"
- C: "object"
- D: "undefined"

<details>
    <summary>
    <b>ðŸ’¡ Answer</b>
    </summary>

**_Answer: B_**

`typeof 1` returns `"number"`.

`typeof "number"` returns `"string"`

</details>

### Q. 37. What's the output?

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[10] = 11;
console.log(numbers);
```

- A: [1, 2, 3, null x 7, 11]
- B: [1, 2, 3, 11]
- C: [1, 2, 3, empty x 7, 11]
- D: SyntaxError

<details>

**_Answer: C_**

When you set a value to an element in an array that exceeds the length of the array, JavaScript creates something called "empty slots". These actually have the value of `undefined`, but you will see something like:

`[1, 2, 3, empty x 7, 11]`

depending on where you run it (it's different for every browser, node, etc.)

### Q. 38. What's the output?

```javascript
(() => {
  let x, y;
  try {
    throw new Error();
  } catch (x) {
    (x = 1), (y = 2);
    console.log(x);
  }
  console.log(x);
  console.log(y);
})();
```

- A: 1 undefined 2
- B: undefined undefined undefined
- C: 1 1 2
- D: 1 undefined undefined

<details>

    <b>ðŸ’¡ Answer</b>
    </summary>

**_Answer: A_**

The `catch` block receives the argument `x`. This is not the same `x` as the variable when we pass arguments. This variable `x` is block-scoped.

Later, we set this block-scoped variable equal to `1`, and set the value of the variable `y`. Now, we log the block-scoped variable `x`, which is equal to `1`.

Outside of the `catch` block, `x` is still `undefined`, and `y` is `2`. When we want to `console.log(x)` outside of the `catch` block, it returns `undefined`, and `y` returns `2`.

### Q. 39. Everything in JavaScript is either a...

- A: primitive or object
- B: function or object
- C: trick question! only objects
- D: number or object

<details>
    <summary>
    <b>ðŸ’¡ Answer</b>
    </summary>

**_Answer: A_**

JavaScript only has primitive types and objects.

Primitive types are `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, `number`, `string`, and `symbol`.

What differentiates a primitive from an object is that primitives do not have any properties or methods; however, you'll note that `'foo'.toUpperCase()` evaluates to `'FOO'` and does not result in a `TypeError`. This is because when you try to access a property or method on a primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the primitive type using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. `String`, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates. All primitives except for `null` and `undefined` exhibit this behaviour.

### Q. 40. What's the output?

```javascript
const arr = [
  [0, 1],
  [2, 3],
];

arr.reduce(
  (acc, cur) => {
    return acc.concat(cur);
  },
  [1, 2],
);
```

- A: [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
- B: [6, 1, 2]
- C: [1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]
- D: [1, 2, 6]

<details>

    </summary>

**_Answer: C_**

`[1, 2]` is our initial value. This is the value we start with, and the value of the very first `acc`. During the first round, `acc` is `[1,2]`, and `cur` is `[0, 1]`. We concatenate them, which results in `[1, 2, 0, 1]`.

Then, `[1, 2, 0, 1]` is `acc` and `[2, 3]` is `cur`. We concatenate them, and get `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`
