### 91. What's the output?

```javascript
let newList = [1, 2, 3].push(4);

console.log(newList.push(5));
```

- A: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- B: `[1, 2, 3, 5]`
- C: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- D: `Error`

<p>

#### Answer: D

The `.push` method returns the _new length_ of the array, not the array itself! By setting `newList` equal to `[1, 2, 3].push(4)`, we set `newList` equal to the new length of the array: `4`.

Then, we try to use the `.push` method on `newList`. Since `newList` is the numerical value `4`, we cannot use the `.push` method: a TypeError is thrown.

###### 92. What's the output?

```javascript
function giveLydiaPizza() {
  return 'Here is pizza!';
}

const giveLydiaChocolate = () => "Here's chocolate... now go hit the gym already.";

console.log(giveLydiaPizza.prototype);
console.log(giveLydiaChocolate.prototype);
```

- A: `{ constructor: ...}` `{ constructor: ...}`
- B: `{}` `{ constructor: ...}`
- C: `{ constructor: ...}` `{}`
- D: `{ constructor: ...}` `undefined`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Regular functions, such as the `giveLydiaPizza` function, have a `prototype` property, which is an object (prototype object) with a `constructor` property. Arrow functions however, such as the `giveLydiaChocolate` function, do not have this `prototype` property. `undefined` gets returned when trying to access the `prototype` property using `giveLydiaChocolate.prototype`.

###### 93. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia',
  age: 21,
};

for (const [x, y] of Object.entries(person)) {
  console.log(x, y);
}
```

- A: `name` `Lydia` and `age` `21`
- B: `["name", "Lydia"]` and `["age", 21]`
- C: `["name", "age"]` and `undefined`
- D: `Error`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`Object.entries(person)` returns an array of nested arrays, containing the keys and objects:

`[ [ 'name', 'Lydia' ], [ 'age', 21 ] ]`

Using the `for-of` loop, we can iterate over each element in the array, the subarrays in this case. We can destructure the subarrays instantly in the for-of loop, using `const [x, y]`. `x` is equal to the first element in the subarray, `y` is equal to the second element in the subarray.

The first subarray is `[ "name", "Lydia" ]`, with `x` equal to `"name"`, and `y` equal to `"Lydia"`, which get logged.
The second subarray is `[ "age", 21 ]`, with `x` equal to `"age"`, and `y` equal to `21`, which get logged.

###### 94. What's the output?

```javascript
function getItems(fruitList, ...args, favoriteFruit) {
  return [...fruitList, ...args, favoriteFruit]
}

getItems(["banana", "apple"], "pear", "orange")
```

- A: `["banana", "apple", "pear", "orange"]`
- B: `[["banana", "apple"], "pear", "orange"]`
- C: `["banana", "apple", ["pear"], "orange"]`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`...args` is a rest parameter. The rest parameter's value is an array containing all remaining arguments, **and can only be the last parameter**! In this example, the rest parameter was the second parameter. This is not possible, and will throw a syntax error.

```javascript
function getItems(fruitList, favoriteFruit, ...args) {
  return [...fruitList, ...args, favoriteFruit];
}

getItems(['banana', 'apple'], 'pear', 'orange');
```

The above example works. This returns the array `[ 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'pear' ]`

###### 95. What's the output?

```javascript
function nums(a, b) {
  if (a > b) console.log('a is bigger');
  else console.log('b is bigger');
  return;
  a + b;
}

console.log(nums(4, 2));
console.log(nums(1, 2));
```

- A: `a is bigger`, `6` and `b is bigger`, `3`
- B: `a is bigger`, `undefined` and `b is bigger`, `undefined`
- C: `undefined` and `undefined`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In JavaScript, we don't _have_ to write the semicolon (`;`) explicitly, however the JavaScript engine still adds them after statements. This is called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion**. A statement can for example be variables, or keywords like `throw`, `return`, `break`, etc.

Here, we wrote a `return` statement, and another value `a + b` on a _new line_. However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as:

```javascript
return;
a + b;
```

This means that `a + b` is never reached, since a function stops running after the `return` keyword. If no value gets returned, like here, the function returns `undefined`. Note that there is no automatic insertion after `if/else` statements!

###### 96. What's the output?

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Lydia';
  }
}

Person = class AnotherPerson {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Sarah';
  }
};

const member = new Person();
console.log(member.name);
```

- A: `"Lydia"`
- B: `"Sarah"`
- C: `Error: cannot redeclare Person`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We can set classes equal to other classes/function constructors. In this case, we set `Person` equal to `AnotherPerson`. The name on this constructor is `Sarah`, so the name property on the new `Person` instance `member` is `"Sarah"`.

###### 97. What's the output?

```javascript
const info = {
  [Symbol('a')]: 'b',
};

console.log(info);
console.log(Object.keys(info));
```

- A: `{Symbol('a'): 'b'}` and `["{Symbol('a')"]`
- B: `{}` and `[]`
- C: `{ a: "b" }` and `["a"]`
- D: `{Symbol('a'): 'b'}` and `[]`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

A Symbol is not _enumerable_. The Object.keys method returns all _enumerable_ key properties on an object. The Symbol won't be visible, and an empty array is returned. When logging the entire object, all properties will be visible, even non-enumerable ones.

This is one of the many qualities of a symbol: besides representing an entirely unique value (which prevents accidental name collision on objects, for example when working with 2 libraries that want to add properties to the same object), you can also "hide" properties on objects this way (although not entirely. You can still access symbols using the `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` method).

###### 98. What's the output?

```javascript
const getList = ([x, ...y]) => [x, y]
const getUser = user => { name: user.name, age: user.age }

const list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const user = { name: "Lydia", age: 21 }

console.log(getList(list))
console.log(getUser(user))
```

- A: `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` and `SyntaxError`
- B: `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`
- C: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`
- D: `Error` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `getList` function receives an array as its argument. Between the parentheses of the `getList` function, we destructure this array right away. You could see this as:

`[x, ...y] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

With the rest parameter `...y`, we put all "remaining" arguments in an array. The remaining arguments are `2`, `3` and `4` in this case. The value of `y` is an array, containing all the rest parameters. The value of `x` is equal to `1` in this case, so when we log `[x, y]`, `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` gets logged.

The `getUser` function receives an object. With arrow functions, we don't _have_ to write curly brackets if we just return one value. However, if you want to instantly return an _object_ from an arrow function, you have to write it between parentheses, otherwise everything between the two braces will be interpreted as a block statement. In this case the code between the braces is not a valid JavaScript code, so a `SyntaxError` gets thrown.

The following function would have returned an object:

`const getUser = user => ({ name: user.name, age: user.age })`

###### 99. What's the output?

```javascript
const name = 'Lydia';

console.log(name());
```

- A: `SyntaxError`
- B: `ReferenceError`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The variable `name` holds the value of a string, which is not a function, thus cannot invoke.

TypeErrors get thrown when a value is not of the expected type. JavaScript expected `name` to be a function since we're trying to invoke it. It was a string however, so a TypeError gets thrown: name is not a function!

SyntaxErrors get thrown when you've written something that isn't valid JavaScript, for example when you've written the word `return` as `retrun`.
ReferenceErrors get thrown when JavaScript isn't able to find a reference to a value that you're trying to access.

###### 100. What's the value of output?

```javascript
// ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ This is my 100th question! âœ¨ðŸŽ‰

const output = `${[] && 'Im'}possible!
You should${'' && `n't`} see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`;
```

- A: `possible! You should see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`
- B: `Impossible! You should see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`
- C: `possible! You shouldn't see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`
- D: `Impossible! You shouldn't see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

`[]` is a truthy value. With the `&&` operator, the right-hand value will be returned if the left-hand value is a truthy value. In this case, the left-hand value `[]` is a truthy value, so `"Im'` gets returned.

`""` is a falsy value. If the left-hand value is falsy, nothing gets returned. `n't` doesn't get returned.
