### 71. How can we log the values that are commented out after the console.log statement?

```javascript
function* startGame() {
  const answer = yield 'Do you love JavaScript?';
  if (answer !== 'Yes') {
    return "Oh wow... Guess we're gone here";
  }
  return 'JavaScript loves you back ‚ù§Ô∏è';
}

const game = startGame();
console.log(/* 1 */); // Do you love JavaScript?
console.log(/* 2 */); // JavaScript loves you back ‚ù§Ô∏è
```

- A: `game.next("Yes").value` and `game.next().value`
- B: `game.next.value("Yes")` and `game.next.value()`
- C: `game.next().value` and `game.next("Yes").value`
- D: `game.next.value()` and `game.next.value("Yes")`

#### Answer: C

A generator function "pauses" its execution when it sees the `yield` keyword. First, we have to let the function yield the string "Do you love JavaScript?", which can be done by calling `game.next().value`.

Every line is executed, until it finds the first `yield` keyword. There is a `yield` keyword on the first line within the function: the execution stops with the first yield! _This means that the variable `answer` is not defined yet!_

When we call `game.next("Yes").value`, the previous `yield` is replaced with the value of the parameters passed to the `next()` function, `"Yes"` in this case. The value of the variable `answer` is now equal to `"Yes"`. The condition of the if-statement returns `false`, and `JavaScript loves you back ‚ù§Ô∏è` gets logged.

### 72. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log(String.raw`Hello\nworld`);
```

- A: `Hello world!`
- B: `Hello` <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`world`
- C: `Hello\nworld`
- D: `Hello\n` <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`world`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`String.raw` returns a string where the escapes (`\n`, `\v`, `\t` etc.) are ignored! Backslashes can be an issue since you could end up with something like:

`` const path = `C:\Documents\Projects\table.html` ``

Which would result in:

`"C:DocumentsProjects able.html"`

With `String.raw`, it would simply ignore the escape and print:

`C:\Documents\Projects\table.html`

In this case, the string is `Hello\nworld`, which gets logged.

### 73. What's the output?

```javascript
async function getData() {
  return await Promise.resolve('I made it!');
}

const data = getData();
console.log(data);
```

- A: `"I made it!"`
- B: `Promise {<resolved>: "I made it!"}`
- C: `Promise {<pending>}`
- D: `undefined`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

An async function always returns a promise. The `await` still has to wait for the promise to resolve: a pending promise gets returned when we call `getData()` in order to set `data` equal to it.

If we wanted to get access to the resolved value `"I made it"`, we could have used the `.then()` method on `data`:

`data.then(res => console.log(res))`

This would've logged `"I made it!"`

### 74. What's the output?

```javascript
function addToList(item, list) {
  return list.push(item);
}

const result = addToList('apple', ['banana']);
console.log(result);
```

- A: `['apple', 'banana']`
- B: `2`
- C: `true`
- D: `undefined`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The `.push()` method returns the _length_ of the new array! Previously, the array contained one element (the string `"banana"`) and had a length of `1`. After adding the string `"apple"` to the array, the array contains two elements, and has a length of `2`. This gets returned from the `addToList` function.

The `push` method modifies the original array. If you wanted to return the _array_ from the function rather than the _length of the array_, you should have returned `list` after pushing `item` to it.

### 75. What's the output?

```javascript
const box = { x: 10, y: 20 };

Object.freeze(box);

const shape = box;
shape.x = 100;

console.log(shape);
```

- A: `{ x: 100, y: 20 }`
- B: `{ x: 10, y: 20 }`
- C: `{ x: 100 }`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

`Object.freeze` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).

When we create the variable `shape` and set it equal to the frozen object `box`, `shape` also refers to a frozen object. You can check whether an object is frozen by using `Object.isFrozen`. In this case, `Object.isFrozen(shape)` returns true, since the variable `shape` has a reference to a frozen object.

Since `shape` is frozen, and since the value of `x` is not an object, we cannot modify the property `x`. `x` is still equal to `10`, and `{ x: 10, y: 20 }` gets logged.

### 76. What's the output?

```javascript
const { name: myName } = { name: 'Lydia' };

console.log(name);
```

- A: `"Lydia"`
- B: `"myName"`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When we unpack the property `name` from the object on the right-hand side, we assign its value `"Lydia"` to a variable with the name `myName`.

With `{ name: myName }`, we tell JavaScript that we want to create a new variable called `myName` with the value of the `name` property on the right-hand side.

Since we try to log `name`, a variable that is not defined, `undefined` is returned on the left side assignment. Later, the value of `Lydia` is stored through the destructuring assignment.

### 77. Is this a pure function?

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

- A: Yes
- B: No

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

A pure function is a function that _always_ returns the same result, if the same arguments are passed.

The `sum` function always returns the same result. If we pass `1` and `2`, it will _always_ return `3` without side effects. If we pass `5` and `10`, it will _always_ return `15`, and so on. This is the definition of a pure function.

### 78. What is the output?

```javascript
const add = () => {
  const cache = {};
  return (num) => {
    if (num in cache) {
      return `From cache! ${cache[num]}`;
    } else {
      const result = num + 10;
      cache[num] = result;
      return `Calculated! ${result}`;
    }
  };
};

const addFunction = add();
console.log(addFunction(10));
console.log(addFunction(10));
console.log(addFunction(5 * 2));
```

- A: `Calculated! 20` `Calculated! 20` `Calculated! 20`
- B: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `Calculated! 20`
- C: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `From cache! 20`
- D: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `Error`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `add` function is a _memoized_ function. With memoization, we can cache the results of a function in order to speed up its execution. In this case, we create a `cache` object that stores the previously returned values.

If we call the `addFunction` function again with the same argument, it first checks whether it has already gotten that value in its cache. If that's the case, the caches value will be returned, which saves on execution time. Else, if it's not cached, it will calculate the value and store it afterwards.

We call the `addFunction` function three times with the same value: on the first invocation, the value of the function when `num` is equal to `10` isn't cached yet. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `false`, and the else block gets executed: `Calculated! 20` gets logged, and the value of the result gets added to the cache object. `cache` now looks like `{ 10: 20 }`.

The second time, the `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

The third time, we pass `5 * 2` to the function which gets evaluated to `10`. The `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

### 79. What is the output?

```javascript
const myLifeSummedUp = ['‚òï', 'üíª', 'üç∑', 'üç´'];

for (let item in myLifeSummedUp) {
  console.log(item);
}

for (let item of myLifeSummedUp) {
  console.log(item);
}
```

- A: `0` `1` `2` `3` and `"‚òï"` `"üíª"` `"üç∑"` `"üç´"`
- B: `"‚òï"` `"üíª"` `"üç∑"` `"üç´"` and `"‚òï"` `"üíª"` `"üç∑"` `"üç´"`
- C: `"‚òï"` `"üíª"` `"üç∑"` `"üç´"` and `0` `1` `2` `3`
- D: `0` `1` `2` `3` and `{0: "‚òï", 1: "üíª", 2: "üç∑", 3: "üç´"}`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With a _for-in_ loop, we can iterate over **enumerable** properties. In an array, the enumerable properties are the "keys" of array elements, which are actually their indexes. You could see an array as:

`{0: "‚òï", 1: "üíª", 2: "üç∑", 3: "üç´"}`

Where the keys are the enumerable properties. `0` `1` `2` `3` get logged.

With a _for-of_ loop, we can iterate over **iterables**. An array is an iterable. When we iterate over the array, the variable "item" is equal to the element it's currently iterating over, `"‚òï"` `"üíª"` `"üç∑"` `"üç´"` get logged.

### 80. What is the output?

```javascript
const list = [1 + 2, 1 * 2, 1 / 2];
console.log(list);
```

- A: `["1 + 2", "1 * 2", "1 / 2"]`
- B: `["12", 2, 0.5]`
- C: `[3, 2, 0.5]`
- D: `[1, 1, 1]`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Array elements can hold any value. Numbers, strings, objects, other arrays, null, boolean values, undefined, and other expressions such as dates, functions, and calculations.

The element will be equal to the returned value. `1 + 2` returns `3`, `1 * 2` returns `2`, and `1 / 2` returns `0.5`.
