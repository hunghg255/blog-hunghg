### 131. What's the output?

```javascript
const emojis = ['ü•ë', ['‚ú®', '‚ú®', ['üçï', 'üçï']]];

console.log(emojis.flat(1));
```

- A: `['ü•ë', ['‚ú®', '‚ú®', ['üçï', 'üçï']]]`
- B: `['ü•ë', '‚ú®', '‚ú®', ['üçï', 'üçï']]`
- C: `['ü•ë', ['‚ú®', '‚ú®', 'üçï', 'üçï']]`
- D: `['ü•ë', '‚ú®', '‚ú®', 'üçï', 'üçï']`

#### Answer: B

With the `flat` method, we can create a new, flattened array. The depth of the flattened array depends on the value that we pass. In this case, we passed the value `1` (which we didn't have to, that's the default value), meaning that only the arrays on the first depth will be concatenated. `['ü•ë']` and `['‚ú®', '‚ú®', ['üçï', 'üçï']]` in this case. Concatenating these two arrays results in `['ü•ë', '‚ú®', '‚ú®', ['üçï', 'üçï']]`.

  }

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}

const counterOne = new Counter();
counterOne.increment();
counterOne.increment();

const counterTwo = counterOne;
counterTwo.increment();

console.log(counterOne.count);
```

- A: `0`
- B: `1`
- C: `2`
- D: `3`

#### Answer: D

`counterOne` is an instance of the `Counter` class. The counter class contains a `count` property on its constructor, and an `increment` method. First, we invoked the `increment` method twice by calling `counterOne.increment()`. Currently, `counterOne.count` is `2`.

Then, we create a new variable `counterTwo`, and set it equal to `counterOne`. Since objects interact by reference, we're just creating a new reference to the same spot in memory that `counterOne` points to. Since it has the same spot in memory, any changes made to the object that `counterTwo` has a reference to, also apply to `counterOne`. Currently, `counterTwo.count` is `2`.

We invoke `counterTwo.increment()`, which sets `count` to `3`. Then, we log the count on `counterOne`, which logs `3`.

### 133. What's the output?

```javascript
const myPromise = Promise.resolve(Promise.resolve('Promise'));

function funcOne() {
  setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout 1!'), 0);
  myPromise.then((res) => res).then((res) => console.log(`${res} 1!`));
  console.log('Last line 1!');
}

async function funcTwo() {
  const res = await myPromise;
  console.log(`${res} 2!`);
  setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout 2!'), 0);
  console.log('Last line 2!');
}

funcOne();
funcTwo();
```

- A: `Promise 1! Last line 1! Promise 2! Last line 2! Timeout 1! Timeout 2!`
- B: `Last line 1! Timeout 1! Promise 1! Last line 2! Promise2! Timeout 2! `
- C: `Last line 1! Promise 2! Last line 2! Promise 1! Timeout 1! Timeout 2!`
- D: `Timeout 1! Promise 1! Last line 1! Promise 2! Timeout 2! Last line 2!`

<details>

#### Answer: C

First, we invoke `funcOne`. On the first line of `funcOne`, we call the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. (see my article on the event loop <a href="https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-event-loop-3dif" >here</a>.)

Then we call the `myPromise` promise, which is an _asynchronous_ operation.

Both the promise and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the function keeps on running while it's busy completing the promise and handling the `setTimeout` callback. This means that `Last line 1!` gets logged first, since this is not an asynchonous operation.

Since the callstack is not empty yet, the `setTimeout` function and promise in `funcOne` cannot get added to the callstack yet.

In `funcTwo`, the variable `res` gets `Promise` because `Promise.resolve(Promise.resolve('Promise'))` is equivalent to `Promise.resolve('Promise')` since resolving a promise just resolves it's value. The `await` in this line stops the execution of the function until it receives the resolution of the promise and then keeps on running synchronously until completion, so `Promise 2!` and then `Last line 2!` are logged and the `setTimeout` is sent to the Web API.

Then the call stack is empty. Promises are _microtasks_ so they are resolved first when the call stack is empty so `Promise 1!` gets to be logged.

Now, since `funcTwo` popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting in the queue (`() => console.log("Timeout 1!")` from `funcOne`, and `() => console.log("Timeout 2!")` from `funcTwo`) get added to the call stack one by one. The first callback logs `Timeout 1!`, and gets popped off the stack. Then, the second callback logs `Timeout 2!`, and gets popped off the stack.

### 134. How can we invoke `sum` in `sum.js` from `index.js?`

```javascript
// sum.js
export default function sum(x) {
  return x + x;
}

// index.js
import * as sum from './sum';
```

- A: `sum(4)`
- B: `sum.sum(4)`
- C: `sum.default(4)`
- D: Default aren't imported with `*`, only named exports

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the asterisk `*`, we import all exported values from that file, both default and named. If we had the following file:

```javascript
// info.js
export const name = 'Lydia';
export const age = 21;
export default 'I love JavaScript';

// index.js
import * as info from './info';
console.log(info);
```

The following would get logged:

```javascript
{
  default: "I love JavaScript",
  name: "Lydia",
  age: 21
}
```

For the `sum` example, it means that the imported value `sum` looks like this:

```javascript
{ default: function sum(x) { return x + x } }
```

We can invoke this function, by calling `sum.default`

### 135. What's the output?

```javascript
const handler = {
  set: () => console.log('Added a new property!'),
  get: () => console.log('Accessed a property!'),
};

const person = new Proxy({}, handler);

person.name = 'Lydia';
person.name;
```

- A: `Added a new property!`
- B: `Accessed a property!`
- C: `Added a new property!` `Accessed a property!`
- D: Nothing gets logged

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With a Proxy object, we can add custom behavior to an object that we pass to it as the second argument. In this case, we pass the `handler` object which contained two properties: `set` and `get`. `set` gets invoked whenever we _set_ property values, `get` gets invoked whenever we _get_ (access) property values.

The first argument is an empty object `{}`, which is the value of `person`. To this object, the custom behavior specified in the `handler` object gets added. If we add a property to the `person` object, `set` will get invoked. If we access a property on the `person` object, `get` gets invoked.

First, we added a new property `name` to the proxy object (`person.name = "Lydia"`). `set` gets invoked, and logs `"Added a new property!"`.

Then, we access a property value on the proxy object, the `get` property on the handler object got invoked. `"Accessed a property!"` gets logged.

### 136. Which of the following will modify the `person` object?

```javascript
const person = { name: 'Lydia Hallie' };

Object.seal(person);
```

- A: `person.name = "Evan Bacon"`
- B: `person.age = 21`
- C: `delete person.name`
- D: `Object.assign(person, { age: 21 })`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With `Object.seal` we can prevent new properties from being _added_, or existing properties to be _removed_.

However, you can still modify the value of existing properties.

### 137. Which of the following will modify the `person` object?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia Hallie',
  address: {
    street: '100 Main St',
  },
};

Object.freeze(person);
```

- A: `person.name = "Evan Bacon"`
- B: `delete person.address`
- C: `person.address.street = "101 Main St"`
- D: `person.pet = { name: "Mara" }`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `Object.freeze` method _freezes_ an object. No properties can be added, modified, or removed.

However, it only _shallowly_ freezes the object, meaning that only _direct_ properties on the object are frozen. If the property is another object, like `address` in this case, the properties on that object aren't frozen, and can be modified.

### 138. What's the output?

```javascript
const add = (x) => x + x;

function myFunc(num = 2, value = add(num)) {
  console.log(num, value);
}

myFunc();
myFunc(3);
```

- A: `2` `4` and `3` `6`
- B: `2` `NaN` and `3` `NaN`
- C: `2` `Error` and `3` `6`
- D: `2` `4` and `3` `Error`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

First, we invoked `myFunc()` without passing any arguments. Since we didn't pass arguments, `num` and `value` got their default values: num is `2`, and `value` the returned value of the function `add`. To the `add` function, we pass `num` as an argument, which had the value of `2`. `add` returns `4`, which is the value of `value`.

Then, we invoked `myFunc(3)` and passed the value `3` as the value for the argument `num`. We didn't pass an argument for `value`. Since we didn't pass a value for the `value` argument, it got the default value: the returned value of the `add` function. To `add`, we pass `num`, which has the value of `3`. `add` returns `6`, which is the value of `value`.

### 139. What's the output?

```javascript
class Counter {
  #number = 10;

  increment() {
    this.#number++;
  }

  getNum() {
    return this.#number;
  }
}

const counter = new Counter();
counter.increment();

console.log(counter.#number);
```

- A: `10`
- B: `11`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

In ES2020, we can add private variables in classes by using the `#`. We cannot access these variables outside of the class. When we try to log `counter.#number`, a SyntaxError gets thrown: we cannot acccess it outside the `Counter` class!

### 140. What's missing?

```javascript
const teams = [
  { name: 'Team 1', members: ['Paul', 'Lisa'] },
  { name: 'Team 2', members: ['Laura', 'Tim'] },
];

function* getMembers(members) {
  for (let i = 0; i < members.length; i++) {
    yield members[i];
  }
}

function* getTeams(teams) {
  for (let i = 0; i < teams.length; i++) {
    // ‚ú® SOMETHING IS MISSING HERE ‚ú®
  }
}

const obj = getTeams(teams);
obj.next(); // { value: "Paul", done: false }
obj.next(); // { value: "Lisa", done: false }
```

- A: `yield getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- B: `yield* getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- C: `return getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- D: `return yield getMembers(teams[i].members)`

<details>
<summary>
<b>Answer</b>
</summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In order to iterate over the `members` in each element in the `teams` array, we need to pass `teams[i].members` to the `getMembers` generator function. The generator function returns a generator object. In order to iterate over each element in this generator object, we need to use `yield*`.

If we would've written `yield`, `return yield`, or `return`, the entire generator function would've gotten returned the first time we called the `next` method.
